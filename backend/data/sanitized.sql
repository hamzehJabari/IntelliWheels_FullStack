Ignoring the 3-Series Compact that was based on an older platform, this iteration of the 3-Series came in sedan, coupe and convertible forms, as well as in wagon trim that never came to the GCC. These variations were enough to solidify this model as the arguably the top-selling entry-luxury car in the market. While lower models managed with cloth upholstery, steel wheels and basic power accessories, the higher trim levels enjoyed leather, premium CD stereo, navigation, alloy wheels, sunroof and other amenities. While all models were rear-wheel-drive, some markets may have gotten a few all-wheel-drive versions of the various models. Manual and automatic transmissions were standard, but some markets may also have automanual gearboxes on some higher models. The sedan debuted in 1999, followed by the coupe in 2000, with 2.0-litre, 2.2-litre, 2.5-litre and 2.8-litre engines, along with 318i, 320i, 323i and 328i designations respectively, and 2-door models getting \"Ci\" badging instead of \"i\" at the end. The year 2001 brought about the hot 3.2-litre M3 version, available in 2-door form only, while all other models got new engines and names, such as upgraded 2.5-litre 325i and new 3.0-litre 330i alongside the existing 318i and 320i. A minor front-end facelift came in 2002 for all models except the M3. A lightweight M3 CSL with an upgraded engine was briefly available unofficially.

Suspension control-arm bushings may need replacing as early as 60,000 kms. A major problem is the VANOS variable-valve-timing unit that craps out under 100,000 kms due to poor O-ring sealing materials drying up as well as cam sensors failing, leading to loss of torque and a rattling sound above 2000 rpm. The cooling system is known to fail catastrophically due to a disintegrating water-pump bearing, leading to immediate coolant loss and overheating. Additional wear items in the cooling system are the plastic electric thermostat and the water reservoir, which require attention every 100,000 kms. Early models had problems with cracks appearing in rear subframe and luggage-trunk floor, but while repair is expensive, this issue doesn\'t really affect those who don\'t abuse the car on a racetrack. Cars built between 2002 and 2004 had a recall for failing ignition coils.
